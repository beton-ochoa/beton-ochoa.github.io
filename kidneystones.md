## Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images




### Statement

I thank [Dr. Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://gda.itesm.mx/faculty/en/professors/gilberto-ochoa-ruiz) for integrating me into the kidney stones team. Also, as soon as I have authorization and the work is published, I will report the codes of the methods used.

 I am currently working on increasing the size of the datasets in patches for classification, extracting features, balancing classes, and classifying with machine learning methods such as xgboost. 


At the moment, I have a conference paper with the kidney stones team that you can check on Arxiv:
