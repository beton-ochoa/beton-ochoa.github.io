## Breast classification on mammography images 


### Statement

I thank [Dr. Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz](https://gda.itesm.mx/faculty/en/professors/gilberto-ochoa-ruiz) for integrating me into the mammography team. Also, as soon as I have authorization and the work is published, I will report the codes of the methods used.

I am currently working on classifying with deep learning methods such as alexnet, vgg16, inception and resnet50.
