### Statement 

I thank [Dr. José de Jesús Rangel-Magdaleno](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=aBNkfEsAAAAJ&hl=es), [Dr. Hayde Peregrina-Barreto](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=Wh2blp0AAAAJ&hl=es), and [Dr. Julio Cesar Ramirez-San-Juan](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=xN03bqgAAAAJ&hl=es) for integrating me into the **speckle team**. Also, as soon as I have authorization and the work is published, I will report the **codes** of the methods used.

I am currently working on **denoising** with wavelets, improve quality image, segmenting with traditional and **clustering** methods such as knn.

### Research

Our research helps to improve the visualization of **blood vessels** inside the **biological tissue**. To achieve this goal we carry out research in biophotonics, high noise signals, **digital image processing**, and segmentation algorithms. 

In this research we address the use of the **Discrete Wavelet Transform** (DWT) as a multilevel filtering method and region segmentation techniques to **improve visualization and localization** in LSI images.
