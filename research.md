### Research interests

  
My interests are in **computer vision** & **biomedical image processing and analysis**, and **machine learning**. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), (a bit of) biophotonics, and biomedical sciences.

### Projects


I'm now working on some interesting **projects**:
*  [Visualization and localization of **blood vessels** in speckle images](/bloodvessels)
*  [Classification of **kidney stones** in endoscopic images](/kidneystones)
*  [Breast classification on **mammography** images](/mammography) `(New project)`
*  [Visualization and analysis of **colony growth** in speckle images](/colonygrowth) `(New project)`
