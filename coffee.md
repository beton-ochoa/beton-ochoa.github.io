### Coffee recommendations ☕️

Coffee recomendation section is inspired by pages of researchers ([Tejaswi Kasarla](https://tkasarla.github.io/more.html), [Justine Sherry](http://www.justinesherry.com/coffee.html), and [Akshay Narayan](https://akshayn.xyz/coffee.html)), who love coffee as much as I do. It is amazing to find personal pages that worship scientific research, and coffee.

I usually buy freshly roasted seeds at my local store, then I grind the coffee at home and finally, I prepare (mainly) expresso coffee in expresso machine, or moka pot. When I prepare american coffee, I do it in the chemex. Sometimes I order coffee online, I highly recommend [Carajillo](https://www.carajillocafe.com) coffee, and also I go to STARBUCKS for a bag of [CHIAPAS](https://www.starbucks.com.mx/promo/Chiapas), or the house blend of [Bola de Oro](https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Cafeteria/Bola-de-Oro-Puebla-110200467396671/).



**Favorite coffee roasters**

* [Café de Mi Abuelo](https://es-la.facebook.com/cafedemiabuelo) (San Pedro Cholula), has the best marago crop. It is a mild coffee, it lifts your spirits, and *every grain is life.*
* [Café Tres Gallos](https://es-la.facebook.com/cafe3gallos) (Puebla), has one of the best house blend of the city. Although it is a little strong (be careful), it has an incredible flavor.


**Favorite coffee shops**

The following list is a tour of the coffee shops you must visit if you ever come to Puebla: 

* My favorite coffee shop is [Café de Mi Abuelo](https://es-la.facebook.com/cafedemiabuelo) (San Pedro Cholula). An excellent place to work, visit Laila (the owner), or spend an afternoon chatting with friends. It has become my refuge and it is like being at home. If you love cappuccino, order one with cajeta and thank me later.
* If you are in the *"Barrio de los sapos",* you can visit [Café Santo Patrono](https://es-la.facebook.com/Cafesantopatrono) (Puebla). It has it all: a beautiful place, the best playlist, excellent coffee and the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted.
* Hidden in a a small place of Puebla, [Manos Artesanales](https://es-la.facebook.com/manosartesanalesam) (Santa María Tonantzintla) is a coffee shop with a beautiful garden (plants, lights and sounds).  It is a place that I don't know how to describe with words.
* I have such good memories in [Café Milagros](https://www.facebook.com/cafemilagros/) (Puebla) that I can only tell you: go! The place is beautiful and very traditional, just around the corner from [Café Santo Patrono](https://es-la.facebook.com/Cafesantopatrono) in the heart of the city. 
* [Café-Tal](https://es-la.facebook.com/pages/category/Cafe/Café-Tal-Cholula-504804126305680/) and [Las Duyas](http://www.churrerialasduyas.com) in the heart of San Pedro Cholula  are a couple of coffee shops you must visit in my dear town.
* [Terraza Museo Amparo](https://museoamparo.com/cafe) (Puebla) is perfect. You can visit the museum or go to work in the library, then go up to the terrace. Enjoy the view of the Cathedral and the domes of the city, it is superb!

### Books

The vast majority of the books I have read are in Spanish. My love for literature was born when I met a great friend, Pablo. I share with you a list of my top favorite books I have read since then: 

**Top favorite books**

* Tokio blues, *Haruki Murakami* (more readed, favorite book ever)
* Persona normal, *Benito Taibo* (everyone child in the world must be read it)
* The Martian, *Andy Weir* (sarcastic, awesome stupid, and genius)
* La tregua, *Mario Benedetti* (a warm hug in the heart)

This is [my personal library](/personal-library) (working on) where you can find a collection of books, comics, pictures and a lot of other things.
