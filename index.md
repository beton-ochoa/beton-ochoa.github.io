## About me

I received a B.E. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from the [Universidad Politécnica de Puebla](/www.uppuebla.edu.mx) (🇲🇽  2015), and an MSc. degree in Biomedical Sciences and Technologies at the [Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica](/www.inaoep.mx) (🇲🇽 2019). 

Currently, I teaching robotics at the university 🤖 📚. Also, I like [black coffee](/https://twitter.com/Blyyenq/status/1279272826726305793?s=20) ☕, novels of [Murakami](/https://twitter.com/Blyyenq/status/1213678392039505922?s=20), and [rhcp songs](/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ht7o5r4iQ) 🎵. 

## Research interests

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in #Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with #Python 🐍.

I'm now working on two interesting projects:

* Visualization and localization of *blood vessels images* with wavelets
* Classification of *kidney stone images* with machine and deep learning

If you want to discuss things of images, follow me on [twitter](/https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
