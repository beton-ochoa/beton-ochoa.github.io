**June 17th-21st, 2024, Seattle. Washington, USA** 
Myself and 5 talented students from my lab (Francisco, Ivan, Carlos Alfredo, Helena and Ricardo) headed this week to **Seattle, USA** to attend the prestigious **Int. Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)**. For the 4th time, I was part of the organization committee of the **LatinX in Computer Vision (LXCV) Research Workshop** and our community is growing stronger each year! We have so many friends from around the world (we are a family of sorts now). The students of my group CV inside are gaining a lot of good contacts as well ☺️

Also, I’m super glad that i was finally able to meet **Nils Ever Murrugarra Llerena** in person. For the first time I have pictures with him and **Estefanía Talavera** in the same room! With this pair or talented and hard working individuals I have been running a **Google Explore CSR** funded coaching program for a year now and with Nils we have an ongoing project supported by **NVIDIA** (from 2022, through a super computer donated for our **LATAM Supercomputing program**). LXAI has ebable this fruitful collaboration and a great friendship 🥰

I was also happy to meet my **Erasmus Mundus Master in Computr Vision** classmate and friend **Natalia Shapovalova**, who I met last year during my visit to the **Microsfot AI for Good lab** in Seattle; she has a very succesfuld carreer in **Amazon** and and I am super happy to see her. I am laso happy to have been able to finally met **Victor Fragoso** from **Microsoft Research** who has helped our community a lot in recent years and whose wife **Saiph Savage** will keynote speaker in our **MICAI** conference at **INAOE** in **Puebla, Mexico** next october.

  >> ![ ](/CVPR_2024_1.png)

The workshop itself was very successful and we had an amazing program --> 

>> ![ ](/LXCV_2024.jpg)

Our keynotes were outstanding and I had the opportunity to participate in two sessions, one as motivational speaker with other amazing mambers of LXAI: **Arturo Deza** (Peru, Algorithic), **Fabian Caba** (Colombia, Adobe), **Rodolfo Valiente** (Cuba, HRL Labs) and a **panel dicussion** about mentoring and the importance sience dissemination with friends and sponsors from **Google** and **Apple**. Another nighlight was of course the **oral presentation** of **Ivan Reyes-Amezcua** a PhD student who I co-supervise along **Dr. Andres Mendez-Vazquez** from **CINVESTAV GDL**, he did an amazing job with his paper and presentation!

 >> ![ ](/CVPR_2024_2.png)

Appart from the amazing **CVPR experience** (a ton of interesting works in 3D reconstruction for instance) we also did a lot of satellite events: we attended a very fruitful social by **Weights and Biases** and **Intel** and thanks to our friend **Sergio Lomeli** from **Amazon** we got the chance to visit the amazing **The Spheres** bulding near the convention center: half a park and half recreational bulding for amazonians, it is really somethings to behold!

 >> ![ ](/CVPR_2024_3.png)

As with any conference, it was also the opportunity to socialize and meet new people and old friends. I had lunch by the seafront with my two **VIBOT** friends Natalia and Xiong, went to have some drinks with our PhD students, I had a meeting to disscus the next steps our **Google Explore CSR** funded project and had a social dinner with other **LXCV chairs** to discuss planes for next year workshop in **Nashville, Tennessee, USA**!!!

>> ![ ](/CVPR_2024_4.png)

Another interesting thing is that I managed to have my recent acqusition (the **Foundations of Computer Vision** book) signed by the three authors (and very astounding researchers) at the **MIT Books** booth in **CVPR**. Overall an amazing experience!

**October 10th, 2022:** Good News! I am editing a special issue with my colleagues **Dr. Sharib Ali (Univ. of Leeds)** and **Dr. Christian Daul (CRAN)**. More details can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/S789EPO7C9), and a description follows:

**Medical image processing methods** nowadays tend to be systematically and completely based on deep learning methods. However, the latter are not always explainable andtheir superiority over deterministic (classical) methods is not always obvious, notably for hollow organ cartography (mapping) or lesion classification.

The aim of this Special Issue is twofold:
The Special Issue will focus on all types of medical image applications and devices in which AI methods (segmentation, classification, 3D reconstruction, image mosaicing, etc.) are still limited and can enable improvement in the exploitation of various other additional imaging modalities.

Secondly, the contributions can be based on either recent deep-learning approaches, or deterministic methods or on a combination of both. The aim here is to discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks of different solutions applicable to usability of medical data and its integration in clinically driven devices.

**September 6th, 2022:** I attended the **GRETSI conference** (Groupe de Recherche et d'Etudes de Traitement du Signal et des Images) which took place in Nancy, France from Sept. 6th to 9th. The idea was to take advantage of this opportunity and visit my colleague Christian Daul in CRAN (Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy) with whom we collaborate in the **RECONDITe project (Real timE Classification Of eNDoscopic kIdney sTonEs)** and also in the PROTEUS project (3D endoscopic view enhancement using computer vision). I also met some old colleagues from the PhD and some very interesting PhD students.
