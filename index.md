### Updates

**September 11 to 14th, 2023, Leeds United Kingdom**: This week I visited the **University of Leeds** as part of our **Worldwide Universities Netwoek (WUN)**  grant with Leeds and the **Universiy of Southampton**. I spent the first few days with my former student **Pedro Chavarrias** (now doing a PhD under **Sharib Ali** supervision) and my PhD **Mansoor Ali** who is doing a sojourn here as part of the project and working on other grants with **Sharib Ali** and his group.

>> ![ ](/wun_leeds0.png)

September 14th we organzed a workshop entitled **"Opportunities and challenges in emerging technologies in healthcare"** in which we invited students and colleagues from several partners.

>> ![ ](/wun_leeds1.png)

We have about 30 online participants and 20 onsite & four talks and a poster session!  The first talk was given by **Dr. Kate Farrahi** from **University of Southampton** who presented her work on **"Deep Cascade Learning"** for **federated learning applications**. It was followed by a talk by me on **"Endoscopic kidney stone recognition using computer vision"**, a project I have with colleagues Christian Daul and done by my PhD **Francisco Lopez Tiro** at Centre de Recherche en Automatique in France and **CV-INSIDE**. After the coffee break we had a very interesting talk by **Carlo Campagnoli** the **Faculty of Medicine and Health** at Leeds, entitled **"Kinematic signatures of spatial perception in prehension movements"**. This is very interesting research with apps in patients with MS and autism! Last by not least, **Dr Sharib Ali** provided a very nice and thorough talk entitled **"Opportunities & challenges in AI for endoscopy and surgery"**.

>> ![ ](/wun_leeds2.png)

Also I'm very glad as we had a relatively large **Latinx in AI** representation here. Peter is doing a PhD with Sharib and presented in our workshop in ECCV and Jose was in Vancouver lat CVPR. Gerardo will be joining soon I hope! Interestingly all people in this photo have been in GDL! 😱🥳😃

**October 10th, 2022:** Good News! I am editing a special issue with my colleagues **Dr. Sharib Ali (Univ. of Leeds)** and **Dr. Christian Daul (CRAN)**. More details can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/S789EPO7C9), and a description follows:

**Medical image processing methods** nowadays tend to be systematically and completely based on deep learning methods. However, the latter are not always explainable andtheir superiority over deterministic (classical) methods is not always obvious, notably for hollow organ cartography (mapping) or lesion classification.

The aim of this Special Issue is twofold:
The Special Issue will focus on all types of medical image applications and devices in which AI methods (segmentation, classification, 3D reconstruction, image mosaicing, etc.) are still limited and can enable improvement in the exploitation of various other additional imaging modalities.

Secondly, the contributions can be based on either recent deep-learning approaches, or deterministic methods or on a combination of both. The aim here is to discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks of different solutions applicable to usability of medical data and its integration in clinically driven devices.
