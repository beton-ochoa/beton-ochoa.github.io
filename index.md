## About me

I received a B.E. degree in Mechatronic Engineering at the [Universidad Politécnica de Puebla](http://www.uppuebla.edu.mx/joomla1/) (🇲🇽  2015), and a MSc. degree in Biomedical Sciences and Technologies at the [Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE)](https://www.inaoep.mx) (🇲🇽 2019). 


Currently, I teaching robotics at the university, and I'm research assistant at INAOE.
Also, I like [black coffee](https://twitter.com/Blyyenq/status/1279272826726305793?s=20) ☕, novels of [Haruki Murakami](https://twitter.com/pictoline/status/1295503185805705220?s=20), and [RHCP music band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ht7o5r4iQ) 🎵.

## Research interests

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍.

I'm now working on two interesting projects:

* Visualization and localization of *blood vessels images*
* Classification of *kidney stone images*

If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an email or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
