### About me
Welcome to my homepage!, I'm a research assistant at the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Tecnologies of the [Instituto Nacional de Astrof√≠sica, √ìptica y Electr√≥nica (INAOE)](https://www.inaoep.mx), and also I'm a collaborator in two interesting [projects](https://friscolt.github.io/research) at [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es). 

I received a MSc. degree in Biomedical Sciences from [INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx) (üá≤üáΩ 2019), and a BE. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Puebla](http://www.uppuebla.edu.mx/joomla1/) (üá≤üáΩ  2015).  Most importantly, I'm always on the lookout for a great espresso.

### Research interests

My interests are in computer vision & medical image processing, and machine learning. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and (a bit) of biophotonics, and medicine. 
  
I'm now working on three interesting projects:

*  [**Visualization and localization of blood vessels in speckle images**](/bloodvessels)
*  [**Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images**](/kidneystones)
*  [**Breast classification on mammography images**](/mammography) `(New project)`

**If you want to know more about these projects, you can click on the points above.** If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an [email](mailto:francisco.lopez@inaoe.mx?subject=%20Hello,%20Francisco)  or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco üá≤üáΩ
