**October 10th, 2022:** Good News! I am editing a special issue with my colleagues **Dr. Sharib Ali (Univ. of Leeds)** and **Dr. Christian Daul (CRAN)**. More details can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/S789EPO7C9), and a description follows:

**Medical image processing methods** nowadays tend to be systematically and completely based on deep learning methods. However, the latter are not always explainable andtheir superiority over deterministic (classical) methods is not always obvious, notably for hollow organ cartography (mapping) or lesion classification.

The aim of this Special Issue is twofold:
The Special Issue will focus on all types of medical image applications and devices in which AI methods (segmentation, classification, 3D reconstruction, image mosaicing, etc.) are still limited and can enable improvement in the exploitation of various other additional imaging modalities.

Secondly, the contributions can be based on either recent deep-learning approaches, or deterministic methods or on a combination of both. The aim here is to discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks of different solutions applicable to usability of medical data and its integration in clinically driven devices.
