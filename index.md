### Positions available/Grants

There are available positions (bachelor, master and PhD) for all these projects via CONACYT (Mexican Council for Science and Technology) and other grants for suitable candidates (contact me for further details). International mobility is strongly encouraged and double diplomas are possible. I strongly advice any prospect students to show qualifications in machine deep learning if possible. Showing evidence of previous projects (thesis, articles, GitHub) or qualifications from Coursera (Deep Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence for Medicine) is highly desired.

### Updates

**November 18th, 2022:** Congrats to our master student **Axel Garcia Vega**, who successfully defended his master thesis today! He was co-supervised by and **Christian Daul** from the **Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAN, France)** and has done a very amazing work during these two years at the CV Inside lab! His thesis was titled **"A novel Dataset and Deep Learning Method for Automatic Exposure Correction in Endoscopic Imaging"** in which we created our own paired dataset for reference based exposure correction of endoscopic frames and we repurposed and iomproved a DL-based methods for testing this Endo4IE dataset against other image enhancenment methods.

Axel had a very productive master: he published a paper **MICAI 20222** in Monterrey (**winning the 3rd best paper award**) and presented a poster at the **LatinX in AI Research Workshop at CVPR** (in person in New Orleans) we have submitted a paper to **ISBI 2023 (Colombia)**. We plan to continue working on a journal paper applying his methods to two different computer vision tasks in endoscopic (3D reconstruction and instrument segmentation).  
I am certain a bright future is waiting for him! Hooray!

**October 10th, 2022:** Good News! I am editing a special issue with my colleagues Dr. Sharbi Ali (Univ. of Leeds) and Dr. Christiab Daul (CRAN). Seails can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/S789EPO7C9), and a description follows:

Medical image processing methods nowadays tend to be systematically and completely based on deep learning methods. However, the latter are not always explainable andtheir superiority over deterministic (classical) methods is not always obvious, notably for hollow organ cartography (mapping) or lesion classification.

The aim of this Special Issue is twofold:
The Special Issue will focus on all types of medical image applications and devices in which AI methods (segmentation, classification, 3D reconstruction, image mosaicing, etc.) are still limited and can enable improvement in the exploitation of various other additional imaging modalities.

Secondly, the contributions can be based on either recent deep-learning approaches, or deterministic methods or on a combination of both. The aim here is to discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks of different solutions applicable to usability of medical data and its integration in clinically driven devices.
