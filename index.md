## About me

Welcome to my webpage!, I'm research assistant at the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Tecnologies of the [Instituto Nacional de Astrof√≠sica, √ìptica y Electr√≥nica (INAOE)](https://www.inaoep.mx). Also, I'm a colaborator in two interesting [projects](https://friscolt.github.io/research) at [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es). 

I received a MSc. degree in Biomedical Sciences and Technologies at [INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx) (üá≤üáΩ 2019), and a B.E. degree in Mechatronic Engineering at the [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Puebla](http://www.uppuebla.edu.mx/joomla1/) (üá≤üáΩ  2015).

## Research interests

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python üêç.

I'm now working on three interesting projects:

*  [**Visualization and localization of blood vessels in speckle images**](/bloodvessels)
*  [**Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images**](/kidneystones)
*  **Breast classification on mammography images** `(New project)`

**If you want to know more about the contributions in these projects, you can click on the points above.** If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an email or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco üá≤üáΩ
