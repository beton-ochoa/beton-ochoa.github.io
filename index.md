### About me

**Gilberto Ochoa Ruiz** is a researcher in **Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Internet of Things.** He has participated as associated researcher and lecturer in several programs accredited by the CONACYT PNPC program, geared around Computer Science and Communication and Information Technologies. He obtained a master in **Computer Vision in Robotics** from [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/)  and a PhD in Computer Vision and Electronic Imaging from the Universite de Bourgogne ([Laboratoire d'Imagerie et Vision Artificielle](https://imvia.u-bourgogne.fr/en/laboratory)). 

He is member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI, Rank I) and of the CONACYT Network on Applied Computational Network (RedICA), the **Mexican Societies of IA (SMIA) and Computer Sc. (AMEXCOMP)**, as well as the **Latinx in AI** ([LXAI](https://www.latinxinai.org/)) Coalition. He as served as reviewer for ICLR, ICML, CVPR and IJCNN and as general chair of the Latinx in Computer Vision Workshops at  ([LXAI @ CVPR](https://www.latinxinai.org/cvpr-2021-about)  and  ([LXAI @ ICCV](https://www.latinxinai.org/iccv-2021-about) and as part of the organization or technical program committees of these efforts, as well as other conferences. He is part of the academic staff o the **Artificial Intelligence Hub** at **Tecnologico de Monterrey** and he became recently academic partner of the [Erasmus Mundus Master in Computational Colour and Spectral Imaging](https://cosi-master.eu/cosi-master-degree/)

### Research interests

His research interests are focused on investigating and implementing novel algorithms and methods for applications in computer vision and medical image analysis. He has ample experience in the design and implementation of smart cameras on FPGA-based Systems-on-Chip for industrial applications (i.e. 3D scanners) at Prefixa Vision Systems and more recently he has become interested in developing optimized machine learning models for edge computing applications.

---

### Research areas

* Artificial Intelligence (Computer vision and machine learning) for medical imaging
* Applied Computational Intelligence, Smart Connected Devices, AI at the edge
* Optimization techniques for designing edge AI models and devices.

### Positions available/Grants

There are available positions (bachelor, master and PhD) for all these projects via CONACYT (Mexican Council for Science and Technology) and other grants for suitable candidates (contact me for further details). International mobility is strongly encouraged and double diplomas are possible. I strongly advice any prospect students to show qualifications in machine deep learning if possible. Showing evidence of previous projects (thesis, articles, GitHub) or qualifications from Coursera (Deep Learning and/or Artificial Intelligence for Medicine) is highly desired.

### Updates

**October 12th, 2022:** Good News! Five members of our group have extended asbtracts accepted at the LatinX in AI research workshop at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) Congrats Francisco Lopez-Tiro, Daniel Flores-Araiza, Pedro Chavarrias Solano, Daniela Herrera and Mansoor Ali Teevno! LXAI at ECCV will be happening virtually in 15 days, see you there!

**October 10th, 2022:** Good News! I am editing a special issue with my colleagues Dr. Sharbi ALi (Univ. of Leeds) and Dr. Christiab Daul (CRAN). Seails can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/S789EPO7C9), and a description follows:

Medical image processing methods nowadays tend to be systematically and completely based on deep learning methods. However, the latter are not always explainable andtheir superiority over deterministic (classical) methods is not always obvious, notably for hollow organ cartography (mapping) or lesion classification.

The aim of this Special Issue is twofold:
The Special Issue will focus on all types of medical image applications and devices in which AI methods (segmentation, classification, 3D reconstruction, image mosaicing, etc.) are still limited and can enable improvement in the exploitation of various other additional imaging modalities.

Secondly, the contributions can be based on either recent deep-learning approaches, or deterministic methods or on a combination of both. The aim here is to discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks of different solutions applicable to usability of medical data and its integration in clinically driven devices.

**October 10th, 2022:** Weekly joint PhD meeting (students from CINVESTAV  and Tec de Monterrey from the Meaning & CV-INSIDE research groups)
This week we are practising our  presentations for MICAI2022 (organized by SMIA) in which we will be presenting 10 (yes 😱) papers!
We are very excited and happy 😁 (before the meeting, I invited the PhD and MSc to the newly opened Tec Chilaquiles)

**October 4th, 2022:** About 3 weeks ago I was invited to give a webinar for IEEE Eingineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) - IEEE Day Tortch webinar series
about our work on endoscopic stone recognition (ESR) with the Centre de Recherche en Automatique de Nancy (CRAM, FR ) and CHRU Nancy 😊 The idea of this series of webinars is to provide a window on the work done in the area of engineering in medicine in the benefit the society: the video con be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmg2KTCxZSw

**September 28th, 2022:** This year we started a joitn course on computer vision for the Meanning and CV-Inside PhD students entitled: Computational Vision
From 3D Computer Vision to Nerf and Beyond! Inn which I will teach image processing and "classical 3D computern vision" to deep learning based apporaches for depth perception and also more recent stuff such as NeRF
