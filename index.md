## About me

Welcome to my webpage! I'm research assistant at the Department of Biomedical Sciences and Tecnologies of the [Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE)](https://www.inaoep.mx).

I received a B.E. degree in Mechatronic Engineering at the [Universidad Politécnica de Puebla](http://www.uppuebla.edu.mx/joomla1/) (🇲🇽  2015), and a MSc. degree in Biomedical Sciences and Technologies at [INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx) (🇲🇽 2019).

## Research interests

My main interest is medical image processing and analysis. This involves multidisciplinary research from computing (mainly), and a bit of biophotonics. Most of my work has been done in Matlab, and I'm doing useful things with Python 🐍.

I'm now working on two interesting projects:

*  [**Visualization and localization of blood vessels in speckle images**](/bloodvessels)
*  [**Classification of kidney stones in endoscopic images**](/kidneystones)

If you want to know more about the contributions in these projects, you can click on the points above. If you want to discuss things of images, or make a collaboration, send me an email or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Friscolt).

Cheers,
Francisco 🇲🇽
